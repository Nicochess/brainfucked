# Brainfuck - Programming Language

| Comands  |  What they do |
|:--------:|---------------|
| > | Move the memory pointer to the right  |
| < | Move the memory pointer to the left  |
| . | Output a value stored in the current memory pointer location  |
| , | Request a input value and store in a current memory pointer location  |
| [ | Structure to repeat comands while the selected memory slot was different than zero  |
| ] | End of the loop structure  |
| + | Increment a bit in a current memory location |
| - | Decrement a bit in a current memory location |

<h3>Ok, but why?</h3>
<p>This is not a comercial programming language, the development experience almost hurt your brain. 
<br>So why use this? No reason. This programming language was designed to have some fun and challenge people to understand how the Turing machine works in his lower level. If you, like me, wants to have some fun, you could go to this website <a href="https://copy.sh/brainfuck/" target="_blank">https://copy.sh/brainfuck/</a> and compile your brainfuck code. </p>
